# Tacit-Knowledge-Engine


This Engine is an AI system designed to function as a "digital shadow" for an any organization's experts.It doesn't just record what they do; it learns why they do it. The core of this engine is a dynamic, evolving Decision Knowledge Graph (DKG). This isn't a static flowchart but a living model of how decisions are made, who is involved, what information is needed, and what the unspoken rules are.
